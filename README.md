# SALES-PREDICTION
This repository consists of the SALES DATA PREDICTION Using ML Algorithm

The objective of this project is to train a linear regression model that can accurately predict sales based on the advertising expenditure across different channels. The model will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess its performance.
